# CoPilotKit Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the integration guide for CopilotKit in our existing React project! CopilotKit offers an open-source AI copilot platform designed to provide context-aware assistance, enhance user interaction, and streamline development processes. In this guide, we'll explain how to add the Copilot API key to your project and explore how CopilotKit can benefit our existing application.

## Getting Started with CopilotKit

To integrate CopilotKit into our React application, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up for CopilotKit**: Visit the CopilotKit website and sign up for an account. Upon registration, you'll receive an API key.

2. **Add Copilot API Key to Your Project**: Open the root directory of our React project and create a new file named `.env` if it doesn't exist already. Add your Copilot API key to the `.env` file using the following format:

    ```
    REACT_APP_COPILOT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    Replace `your_api_key_here` with the API key you received from CopilotKit.

3. **Access Copilot Services in Your Application**: With the API key added, we can now access Copilot services in our application. We can make HTTP requests to the Copilot server to fetch responses from copilots and integrate them into our app's functionality.

## How CopilotKit Can Help in Our Project

Integrating CopilotKit into our existing React project offers several advantages:

- **Context-Aware Assistance**: With CopilotKit, we can implement context-aware in-app chatbots that execute actions within the app. These copilots can provide users with assistance based on the current context, such as guiding them through form submissions, suggesting relevant actions, or providing help documentation.

- **AI-Enhanced Text Fields**: CopilotKit enables us to create AI-enhanced text fields offering context-sensitive autocomplete and insertions. This feature can enhance user experience by predicting user input, suggesting relevant options, and reducing manual effort in data entry tasks.

- **Seamless Interaction**: CopilotKit facilitates the integration of in-app AI agents that interact seamlessly with both our application and its users. These agents can offer personalized recommendations, answer user queries, and provide real-time assistance, thereby improving user engagement and satisfaction.

By integrating CopilotKit into our existing React application, we can enhance user experience, streamline development processes, and introduce innovative features that elevate the functionality of our project.
